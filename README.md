# ✂️ Clipper
Clipper is a very simple video editor that is designed to trim down clips to include only the part that was intended to be clipped. A focus is put on editing speed, and dealing with many clips in bulk.

For those that don't know what a clip it, its a short video that records what previously happened. This means people can record special moments without having to record all the time.

As an example, if someone was to record a clip that was 40 seconds, but they only wanted to save the last 5 seconds, they would need to manually open the clip in a video editor, find the part that they want, trim it on both ends, then export it. With clipper this can be done automatically, and adjustments can be made in seconds.

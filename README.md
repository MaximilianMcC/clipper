# ✂️ Clipper
Clipper is a simplified video editor that is designed for automatically, or manually, clipping existing clips to find part the parts that you really want to save. There is a massive focus on editing clips in bulk, and speed/efficiency is a top priority.

## Running
1. Make sure you have FFMPEG and FFPROBE downloaded and added to path
1. Download/build the project if there isn't already a release
1. Run the program with the first argument being the video path (eg: `clipper.exe ./video.mp4`)
